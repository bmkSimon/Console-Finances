# Console-Finances
This is assignment 5 in the DTTP class starting in January 2024.
This activity presents a real-world situation in which we are tasked with creating
code for analyzing the financial records of a company. 
A financial dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses in 
the starter/index.js file, was provided.

JavaScript code was written to analyze the records and to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire
period.
- The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire
period.

Final code prints the analysis to the console and also displays it to the browser window.
